      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is an operating system for containers. It is like a virtual machine but unlike virtual machine rather than creating a virtual operating system Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application. Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands you can use to build, start, or stop containers. Using Docker it is easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is a industry standard open source web-server but at its core it really is a reverse proxy. It scales really well as Web Server as well as a reverse proxy, because it does not allocate a process per connection (like the old Apache) but instead it just creates a pool of processes which is used/shared among multiple requests. A process is allocated a resource only when a request is made. This has far less resource consumption for supporting large amount of connections. It can also do other important things, such as load balancing and HTTP caching.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>First let's see what is virtualization. virtualization technology decouples the application and operating system from the underlying hardware, and allows many applications to run on one physical server. A virtual machine, or VM, is a layer of software that runs on top of a virtualization management layer and encapsulates an entire independent software stack of an operating system and various applications. Since multiple VMs can be loaded on a computer, multiple operating systems and applications can run simultaneously on a single unit - you can basically run linux, windows, and OSX on the same machine. Virtualization allow one large application to run across several servers.

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud computing vendor that offers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for software developers. DigitalOcean is very popular with open source developers and competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and
      Google Compute Engine. To deploy DigitalOcean's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, developers launch a private virtual machine (VM) instance, which DigitalOcean calls a "droplet." Developers choose the droplet's size, which geographical region and data center it will run in, and which Linux operating system it will use: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS or FreeBSD. Developers use the DigitalOcean manage and monitor their droplets with a control panel and an open source API.
