      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>GIT is an open source distributed version control system. This means Git is not only used to store code and content, the version control functionality helps in maintainability of the content stored by maintaining a history of changes that have happened. Git is distributed because Git has a local repository and server repository which means that the code/ content is not only stored in the central server, it is also present in developers' computer. Git is designed to handle everything with speed and efficiency.
      <br> We need source code version control system because ofthe following reasons: 
      <br> Collaboration: Without version control system, no one is allowed to make changes when one member of the team is making changes, which is not an acceptable work flow. Also, it is error prone as sooner or later someone will over wite someone else's changes. With version control system in place, it is easy to collaborate our work with other peoples' work and people can work parallely on the same code.
      <br> Storing Versions: Saving each version of the file with version control system is confusing. Very few people do it properly and also, even if people do it peoperly it takes lot of time and it is very tedious. And most important thing is, it is very difficult to know what changes are there in each version of the file from the cover, since the files and code are usually large and complex. A version control system acknowledges that there is only one project. Therefore, there's only the one version that we are currently working on. Everything else - all the past versions and variants - are neatly packed up. When we need it, we can request any version at any time and we'll have a snapshot of the complete project right at hand.
      <br> Restoring Previous Version: It is easy to restore all the previous versions using version control system. If the changes made on the current file are not needed anymore then we can undo them anytime.
      Continous Integration and Code review: Developers can create branches and work on their changes and integrate it later. If the integration results in code failure, developers can undo their changes. Not only this, with version control system it is easier to review everybody's changes.

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project: multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>Git has two repository types: Local and Remote. 
      <br> Local Repo: Local Repo is the one on which we make changes. It is typically on our computer. It has all the files and their commit history, enabling full data comparison that calculates and displays the differences between two files, history review, and committing when offline.  This is one of the key features of a distributed version control system, locally having the full repository history.
      <br> Remote Repo: Git refers to the centralized server as a remote repository. Remote repo is a common repository that every member of the team use to incorporate and exchange their changes.  In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. In contrast to a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state. Instead, it only consists of the .git versioning data.
      <br> How to use GIT in Team Project: If all the team members have commit access to the repo, then the members will pull changes from the remote repo make their own changes, commit locally, and then push back into the public repo when they have something working. On the other hand if only one or few developers are responsible for the changes, other members can create their own branch (for each feature or fix) and make and push their changes on the branch. <br> Following are the steps for the same: 
      <br> 1.Create one branch for each feature you need to work on. These branches will come from a base development branch, where all the dev code resides
      <br> 2.Each developer will work on their respective feature branches until they are considered ready
      <br> 3.Once ready, they’ll be merged back to their source
      <br> 4.When all features are ready, you’ll create a release branch from development, where only bug fixes will be accepted to ensure no half-finished feature are deployed.
